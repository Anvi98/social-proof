### What I learned

In this simple project, I basically learned Tailwind Css. How to apply Tailwinds Css with A react Component.



### Useful resources

- [Tailwind-Css](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This helped me for applying tailwind properties since it's my first experience with the library. Tailwind is a fine framework. I will continue to use it.
